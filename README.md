# Drum-Kit
I made an interactive web based drum kit.
I added the layout in index.html and styling and images in styles.css.
Then I added Event listeners to add sounds for both clicking and keyboard functionality in index.js and using the switch functionality.
Lastly I added animations when a drum is selected and used a setTimeout function.
